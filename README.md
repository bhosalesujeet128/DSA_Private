### String  
In Java, a String is a sequence of characters used to represent textual data. It is a class in the java.lang package and is immutable, meaning once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed.  
A String is a class, but Java allows us to use it like a data type.  
String literals(sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes) are stored in a special memory area called the String pool to optimize memory usage.  
Reusing literals saves memory, while using `new String()` creates a new object in the heap.  
Java provides many built-in methods to manipulate strings like   
- `.length()`, `.substring()` , `.charAt()`, `.equals()`, etc.
